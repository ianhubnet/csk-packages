# 🧩 CSK Packages

This repository serves as the **central monorepo** for all **CiSkeleton (CSK)** packages — including modules, plugins, themes, and language packs.

Each package is managed as a **Git submodule**, enabling independent development, versioning, and distribution — while maintaining a unified structure for automation, updates, and releases.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Packages are organized by type:

```
packages/
├──languages
├──modules/
├──plugins/
└──themes/
```

Each subfolder contains Git submodule references to official CSK packages. Some packages may be private or access-restricted.

| Type      | Description                                  | Access |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------- | :----: |
| Languages | Translation packs                            |   🔒   |
| Modules   | Extend core functionality (e.g., Blog, Shop) |   🔒   |
| Plugins   | Add features or integrations                 |   🔒   |
| Themes    | Frontend themes                              |   🔒   |

## 🛠️ Purpose

* Keep all official CSK extensions organized in one place.
* Provide a base for the CSK **in-app Marketplace**.
* Simplify updates, packaging, and distribution pipelines.
* Serve as a package index for automation, release tooling, and marketplace metadata.

## ⚙️ Automation
New packages register themselves automatically when they define:
- `CSK_NAME` variable → name of the package (e.g., `pages`).
- `CSK_TYPE` variable → type of the package (`module`, `theme`, etc.).
- `IANHUB_AGENT_CLIENT_ID` and `IANHUB_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` → for communication.

> 🪄 This system allows decentralized development while maintaining a synchronized ecosystem.
