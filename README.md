# CI Skeleton Packages

This is the **private monorepo** for all official **CodeIgniter Skeleton (CSK)** packages, including modules and themes.

Each module or theme is managed as a **Git submodule**, allowing independent versioning, development, and releases. This repo acts as a central aggregation point to:

* Keep everything organized in one place
* Easily pull all CSK modules/themes at once
* Provide a base for building update ZIPs and distributions
* Power the backend for CSK's in-app marketplace or dashboard
